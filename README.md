# First Time Setup Middleware

A lightweight, extensible middleware library for .NET Blazor applications that provides a wizard-based first-time setup experience. This library makes it easy to add a professional setup wizard to your Blazor projects, ensuring administrators configure critical settings before the application becomes publicly accessible.

## Overview

This middleware intercepts all requests to your application and redirects them to a multi-step setup wizard until the setup process is completed. It's designed to be simple to integrate, easy to customize, and provides a clean, modern UI out of the box.

## Features

- **Request Interception**: Automatically redirects all requests to the setup wizard until configuration is complete
- **Password Protection**: Secure setup wizard with generated password (enabled by default)
- **Multi-Step Wizard**: Extensible step-based wizard with progress tracking
- **Builder Pattern**: Fluent API for adding custom setup steps
- **Blazor Components**: Pre-built UI components for forms, toggles, checkboxes, and more
- **File/Config Based State**: Simple file marker or configuration setting to track setup completion
- **Extensible**: Third-party features can bundle and register their own setup steps
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with professional styling (see [Interactive Prototype](docs/reference/setup-wizard-v2.html))

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
dotnet add package cpike.Setup.Middleware
```

### Basic Usage

**1. Register the setup wizard in `Program.cs`:**

```csharp
using cpike.Setup.Middleware.Extensions;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add your normal services
builder.Services.AddRazorComponents();
builder.Services.AddServerSideBlazor();

// Add setup wizard with custom steps
builder.Services.AddSetupWizard(setup =>
{
    setup.AddStep<AdminAccountStep>();
    setup.AddStep<SystemRolesStep>();
    setup.AddStep<InviteSystemStep>();
});

var app = builder.Build();

// IMPORTANT: Add setup middleware BEFORE authentication/authorization
app.UseSetupMiddleware();

app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

app.Run();
```

**2. Access your application:**

When you first run the application, you'll see the setup password in the console:

```
========================================
SETUP WIZARD ACCESS PASSWORD
========================================
Your setup wizard is protected.
Enter this password to begin setup:

    XpK7-mN94-Qr2L-vB8j

========================================
```

**3. Complete the setup wizard:**

Navigate to your application URL, enter the password, and complete the multi-step wizard. Once finished, the application will be accessible to all users.

### Creating Custom Steps

Create a Blazor component that inherits from `SetupStepBase`:

**AdminAccountStep.razor:**

```razor
@inherits SetupStepBase
@inject UserManager<ApplicationUser> UserManager

<div class="step-header">
    <h2>@Title</h2>
    <p>@Description</p>
</div>

<div class="form-group">
    <label>Email Address</label>
    <input type="email" @bind="Email" class="form-input" />
</div>

<div class="form-group">
    <label>Password</label>
    <input type="password" @bind="Password" class="form-input" />
</div>

@code {
    public override string Title => "Create Administrator Account";
    public override string Description => "This account will have full access to all system features.";
    public override int Order => 10;

    private string Email { get; set; }
    private string Password { get; set; }

    public override async Task<ValidationResult> ValidateAsync()
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(Email))
            return ValidationResult.Failure("Email is required");

        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(Password))
            return ValidationResult.Failure("Password is required");

        return ValidationResult.Success;
    }

    public override async Task ExecuteAsync()
    {
        var user = new ApplicationUser
        {
            Email = Email,
            UserName = Email
        };

        await UserManager.CreateAsync(user, Password);
        await UserManager.AddToRoleAsync(user, "Administrator");

        // Store for later steps
        StateManager.Set("AdminEmail", Email);
    }
}
```

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: MVP Development

This project is currently in early development. The initial version focuses on:

- Core middleware functionality
- Basic wizard framework
- File-based setup completion tracking
- Essential UI components

Future enhancements will include database-backed state management, additional components, and more advanced features.

## Use Case

This library is primarily built for personal Blazor projects but is open-sourced for community use and contributions. It solves the common problem of needing a one-time setup wizard for administrative configuration before opening an application to users.

**Ideal for:**

- Self-hosted Blazor applications
- Internal tools requiring initial configuration
- Multi-tenant apps needing per-tenant setup
- Applications that need admin account creation on first run

## Configuration

### Disable Password Protection (Development)

For local development, you can disable password protection:

**appsettings.Development.json:**

```json
{
  "Setup": {
    "RequirePassword": false
  }
}
```

### Customize Wizard Appearance

Override CSS custom properties to match your brand:

**wwwroot/css/site.css:**

```css
:root {
    --setup-primary-blue: #your-brand-color;
    --setup-font-family: 'Your Font', sans-serif;
}
```

**See [CSS Customization](docs/CSS-CUSTOMIZATION.md) for complete theming guide.**

## Example Application

A complete working example is available in the `cpike.Setup.Middleware.Tester` project, demonstrating:

- Admin account creation
- System role configuration
- Invite system setup
- Review and confirmation flow

## FAQ

### How do I get the setup password?

Check the console output when your application starts, or look for the password file at `/app_data/setup-password.txt`.

### Can I run the setup wizard again?

By default, setup can only run once. Delete the `.setup-complete` marker file to re-run setup.

### How do I customize the wizard appearance?

Override CSS custom properties in your stylesheet. See [CSS Customization](docs/CSS-CUSTOMIZATION.md).

### Can I add steps from a third-party library?

Yes! Third-party libraries can register steps that integrate seamlessly. See [Creating Custom Steps](docs/CREATING-CUSTOM-STEPS.md#third-party-step-registration).

### Does this work with Blazor WebAssembly?

The MVP targets Blazor Server. WebAssembly support is planned for a future release.
